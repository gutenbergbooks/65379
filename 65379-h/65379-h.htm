<p class="tb">Aunt Sammy came to life with
the first radio broadcast of
&ldquo;Housekeeper&rsquo;s Chat&rdquo; on October
4, 1926. The character of
Aunt Sammy&mdash;wife of Uncle Sam&mdash;was
created by the USDA Bureau
of Home Economics and
the Radio Service. Many women
across the country played the
part as they spoke into the microphones
of local radio stations.</p>
<p>The highlights of Aunt Sammy&rsquo;s
show were the menus and
recipes, but Aunt Sammy also
talked about clothing, furniture,
appliances, and other family and
household matters. Aunt Sammy
wasn&rsquo;t just a homebody, however.
She commented on world
affairs, reported the latest fads,
and told jokes. The talk moved
easily from one subject to
another, always natural and
entertaining as well as informative.</p>
<p>Aunt Sammy soon became popular.
By the end of the first year
her program was carried by 43
radio stations. By 1932, 194 stations
were broadcasting Aunt
Sammy&rsquo;s show. A number of the
stations were broadcasting the
show five times a week.</p>
<p>Many listeners wrote for copies
of the recipes, and the Bureau
of Home Economics answered
these requests with weekly mimeographed
sheets. In 1927 the most
popular recipes were assembled
into a pamphlet. The demand was
so great that it had to be reprinted
after only a month.
&ldquo;Aunt Sammy&rsquo;s Radio Recipes&rdquo;
was revised and enlarged three
times between 1927 and 1931. In
1932 it became the first cookbook
published in braille.</p>
<p>Aunt Sammy faded out during
the Great Depression. After 1934
the name Aunt Sammy was no
longer used. The radio show became
drier and more factual
and was renamed &ldquo;Homemaker
Chats.&rdquo; In 1946 it was discontinued.</p>
<p>Today, consumers are still looking
to USDA for information on
how to make the best use of the
food available to them. A research
program in the Consumer and
Food Economics Institute of the
Science and Education Administration
provides the basis for numerous
laboratory-tested recipes.</p>
<p>Current recipes emphasize
time-saving techniques, moneysaving
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
ingredients, and good nutrition.
Taste panels are used to
evaluate new recipes.</p>

<p>Research has provided a group
of publications for the consumer
on specific foods such as fruits,
vegetables, eggs, beef, poultry,
cheese, milk, and soybeans. The
series is designed to give information
about buying, storing, and
using specific commodities. These
and other publications help consumers
use a wide variety of
foods to obtain nutritious, appetizing,
and economical meals.</p>
<p>Providing directions for home
canning and freezing is another
service of the Consumer and Food
Economics Institute. Publications
give safe procedures for preserving
fruits, vegetables, meats, and
poultry. Many thousands of these
publications have been distributed
to consumers, and the procedures
have been widely used by
others who make recommendations
to the public about food
preservation. Still other publications
tell how to store food
properly for maximum quality
and safety.</p>
<p>This 50th anniversary recipe
collection includes recipes from
current publications and a selection
of recipes from the first edition
of &ldquo;Aunt Sammy&rsquo;s Radio
Recipes.&rdquo; All of these recipes
have been retested in the laboratory
and found acceptable by
taste panels.</p>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small"><span class="large">RECIPES FROM THE 1920&rsquo;s ...</span></span></h2>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Soups</span></h2>
<h3 id="c3">Onion Soup Au Gratin</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>3 cups meat broth.</dt>
<dt>6 medium-sized onions, chopped.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>4 tablespoons flour.</dt>
<dt>2 tablespoons cold water.</dt>
<dt>Pepper.</dt>
<dt>Toast.</dt>
<dt>Parmesan cheese.</dt></dl>
<p>Cook the chopped onions in a small amount of water until tender.
Add 2 tablespoons of fat from the meat broth or the same quantity
of butter and let the onions cook down in this until they are yellow.
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
Mix them with the meat broth and salt and thicken with the flour
and cold water which have been blended. Cook for a few minutes.
Season with pepper as desired. Pour the soup into bowls or soup
plates, place on top a round or slice of toasted bread, and sprinkle
grated cheese over the bread and soup. Serve at once.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Milk-Vegetable Soups</h3>
<p>Milk-vegetable soups are made from cooked vegetables (chopped
or sliced) and milk slightly thickened. The vegetables may be asparagus,
peas, beans of various kinds, celery, potatoes, turnips, carrots,
spinach, onions, corn, cabbage, or almost any other vegetable.
Some of these are good in combination, such as potatoes and onions,
potatoes and turnips, turnips and carrots.</p>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>2 cups milk.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon flour or less.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon butter.</dt>
<dt>Salt.</dt>
<dt>&#8532; cup cooked vegetables, finely chopped, mashed or strained.</dt></dl>
<p>Thicken the milk with the flour as for white sauce. Add the other
ingredients. If the vegetable is starchy, use less flour or thin the
soup with milk. The vegetables should be finely chopped, mashed, or
strained, so that they will blend well with the thickened milk.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Main Dishes</span></h2>
<h3 id="c6">Shepherd&rsquo;s Pie</h3>
<p>Grease a 2-quart baking dish and cover the sides with a thin
layer of seasoned mashed potato. Use about 2&frac12; cups potato. Fill
the center with about 4&frac12; cups well-seasoned, slightly thickened
stew, creamed chicken, or creamed fish. There should be no potatoes
in the stew. Cover the top with 1 cup mashed potato and bake in a
hot oven (400&deg;F.) until the pie is hot through and slightly browned
on top.</p>
<p>NOTE: The recipe for Beef Stew on <a href="#Page_13">page 13</a> may be used.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Fricasseed Chicken with Dumplings</h3>
<p>Cut chicken into pieces for serving. Roll each piece in flour and
brown in hot fat. Browning the chicken before cooking it helps retain
and develop the flavor. After the pieces are browned, simmer
until tender in enough water to cover. When it is done, take the
chicken out and cook dumplings in the gravy. Serve the chicken in
the center of a platter with the dumplings around the edge. Pour
the gravy over the chicken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<h3 id="c8">Dumplings</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 cup flour.</dt>
<dt>2&frac12; teaspoons baking powder.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>1 egg.</dt>
<dt>&#8531; cup milk.</dt></dl>
<p>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together. Beat the egg well,
add the milk, and mix with the dry ingredients. Drop by small spoonfuls
into the chicken gravy. Cover tightly and cook for 15 minutes.
The top must not be removed while the dumplings are cooking.
If the steam escapes, the dumplings will not be light.</p>
<h3 id="c9">Baked Cheese and Macaroni</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>2 cups macaroni or spaghetti, broken in small pieces.</dt>
<dt>4 tablespoons flour.</dt>
<dt>4 tablespoons butter.</dt>
<dt>2 cups milk.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; pound American cheese.</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>Butter.</dt>
<dt>Soft bread crumbs.</dt></dl>
<p>Cook the macaroni or spaghetti in 2 quarts of boiling salted water
until tender. Drain. Make a sauce with the flour, butter, milk, and
salt. Grate or cut the cheese into the sauce, reserving a little to grate
over the top of the dish.</p>
<p>Place the macaroni in a buttered baking dish, in alternate layers
with the cheese sauce. Scatter the extra grated cheese over the top
with buttered bread crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven (350&deg;F.) until
the sauce and macaroni are hot through and the crumbs are brown.</p>
<h3 id="c10">Smothered Ham with Sweetpotatoes</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 slice of smoked ham, cut into sizes for serving.</dt>
<dt>3 cups raw, sliced sweetpotatoes.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon butter or ham drippings.</dt>
<dt>2 tablespoons sugar.</dt>
<dt>1 cup hot water.</dt></dl>
<p>Brown the ham lightly on both sides and arrange it to cover the
bottom of a baking dish. Spread the sliced sweetpotatoes over the
ham. Sprinkle with sugar. Add the hot water and fat. Cover the
dish and bake slowly at 350&deg;F. (moderate oven) until the ham is
tender. Baste the potatoes occasionally with the liquid. Brown the
top well.</p>
<h3 id="c11">Creamed Oysters</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 quart oysters.</dt>
<dt>2&frac12; cups milk and oyster liquor.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup butter.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup flour.</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>&#8539; teaspoon pepper.</dt>
<dt>&frac14; teaspoon onion juice, if desired.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Cook the oysters in their liquor until the edges begin to curl.
Do not let them cook too long or they will be tough. Strain off the
liquor. To about 1 cup of this liquor, add enough milk to make
2&frac12; cups. Melt the butter and add the flour, stirring until blended.
Add the liquid. Cook for 5 or 10 minutes to do away with the starchy
flavor of the flour. Add the oysters and seasoning and serve at once
in patty shells or on toast. If creamed oysters stand, the sauce becomes
thin.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">Vegetables</span></h2>
<h3 id="c13">Harvard Beets</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>6 medium-sized beets.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup sugar.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; tablespoon cornstarch.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup vinegar.</dt>
<dt>2 tablespoons butter.</dt></dl>
<p>Wash beets, cook in boiling water until tender, remove the skins,
and cut the beets into thin slices or cubes. Mix the sugar and cornstarch.
Add the vinegar, and let the sauce boil for 5 minutes, stirring
constantly. Just as the sauce is taken from the fire add the butter.
Pour sauce over beets. Let them stand on the back of the stove for a
few minutes so that the beets may absorb the sweet-sour flavor of
the sauce.</p>
<h3 id="c14">Baked Cucumbers</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>3 good-sized cucumbers.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; cup fine dry breadcrumbs.</dt>
<dt>3 tablespoons butter.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; tablespoons chopped onion.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; teaspoons finely chopped parsley.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon chopped celery.</dt>
<dt>1 cup tomatoes cut in pieces.</dt></dl>
<p>Wash cucumbers and cut in half lengthwise. Scoop out as much
as possible of the pulp without breaking the skin. Brown the onion
in the fat, add other ingredients mixed with the cucumber pulp.
Stir constantly, and cook five minutes, or until dry. Place the filling
in the cucumber shells and bake until the shells are soft and the
mixture is brown on top.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Browned Parsnips</h3>
<p>Scrub parsnips clean, drop into boiling, lightly salted water, and
cook for 15 to 30 minutes or until tender. Drain, scrape off the skin,
split lengthwise, and pull out the stringy cores. Dip the pieces in
flour and fry in fat until golden brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h3 id="c16">Corn Fritters</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 cup liquid, either juice from canned corn or milk, or the two mixed.</dt>
<dt>1 cup drained canned corn.</dt>
<dt>1&frac34; cups sifted cake flour</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon melted fat.</dt>
<dt>1 egg.</dt>
<dt>2 teaspoons baking powder.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; teaspoon salt.</dt></dl>
<p>Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt. Mix the juice from the
canned corn or milk, or whatever liquid is used, the egg after it has
been beaten slightly, and the canned corn. Stir this liquid mixture
gradually into the dry ingredients. Add the melted fat. If the corn is
very moist, even after the liquid has been drained from it, more
flour may be needed.</p>
<p>Fry the corn fritters in deep fat, or if preferred, in a skillet in
shallow fat. In either case, drop the mixture by spoonfuls into the
fat and fry rather slowly. The fritters need time to cook through to
the center before the outside becomes too brown. Drain the fritters
on absorbent paper and serve hot.</p>
<h3 id="c17">Scalloped Onions and Peanuts</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>6 medium-sized onions.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup peanuts, ground.</dt>
<dt>1 cup thin white sauce, made with 1 tablespoon flour, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1 cup milk.</dt></dl>
<p>Cook the skinned onions in boiling water until tender. Drain and
slice with a sharp knife. Place the onions in layers in a greased baking
dish, cover each layer with the cream sauce and the peanuts, and
continue until all ingredients are used. Cover the top with buttered
crumbs and bake in a moderate oven (350&deg;F.) until golden brown.
Serve from the baking dish.</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">Fruits</span></h2>
<h3 id="c19">Fried Apples and Bacon</h3>
<p>Select about six good tart apples. Peel them. Cut them in 1-inch
cubes. Fry the bacon in a heavy skillet. As soon as the slices of
bacon are crisp, remove and drain them on clean brown paper and
keep in a warm place. Leave about one-fourth cup bacon fat in the
skillet and fill it with apples. Sprinkle on 3 tablespoons of sugar.
Apples fried this way require a little more sugar than ordinary
fried apples. Cover the apples. Cook slowly until tender. Then remove
the cover and turn apples gently, so the pieces will keep their
shape. Let them brown lightly. They are then almost transparent.
Place them on a hot platter, and surround them with the crisp
bacon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">7</div>
<h3 id="c20">Scalloped Apples</h3>
<p>Pare, core, and slice tart apples, preferably those of a kind that
will hold their shape when cooked. Place a layer of the sliced apples
in a baking dish, sprinkle with sugar, dot with butter, or pour on a
little melted butter. Put in another layer of apples and keep on
until the dish is heaping full. Press the apples down and put in as
many as possible. Cover the dish and cook the apples slowly for 1
to 1&frac12; hours in a 300&deg;F. (slow) oven. Fifteen minutes before the
apples are to be served, remove the cover and spread buttered bread
crumbs over the top. Return to the oven and let the crumbs become
golden brown and crisp. The apples themselves will be in whole
pieces and almost transparent. Some kinds will be pink in color.
Scalloped apples are good served hot with main course of dinner
or supper.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">Salads</span></h2>
<h3 id="c22">Cabbage and Carrot Salad</h3>
<p>Use equal parts of grated carrots and finely shredded cabbage.
Mix the carrots and cabbage together with salad dressing until well
blended. Serve on crisp lettuce.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Stuffed Celery</h3>
<p>Cut the celery into pieces convenient for handling. Fill the hollow
of the celery stalks with cream cheese mixed with chopped pimiento,
green pepper, and chopped nuts. Serve on the plate with another
salad or as a relish.</p>
<h3 id="c24">Potato Salad</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>4 medium-sized potatoes.</dt>
<dt>1 cup finely cut celery.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; teaspoons salt.</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon grated onion or more.</dt>
<dt>&frac14; cup chopped pickle.</dt>
<dt>1 cup salad dressing.</dt></dl>
<p>Cook the potatoes in their jackets in boiling salted water. As
soon as the potatoes are tender, but not soft, drain them and remove
the skins. When they are cold, cut the potatoes in small uniform
cubes. Add the celery, onion, pickle, salt, and salad dressing.
Mix together lightly to avoid breaking the potatoes and making them
mushy. Chill thoroughly and serve on crisp lettuce leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<h3 id="c25">Tomato Aspic Salad</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>2 envelopes gelatin.</dt>
<dt>1 quart canned tomatoes.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon finely chopped green pepper.</dt>
<dt>2 tablespoons finely chopped celery.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley.</dt>
<dt>1 cup very finely shredded cabbage.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; teaspoons salt.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon onion juice.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon sugar.</dt></dl>
<p>Soak the gelatin in a small quantity of water. Boil the tomatoes for
5 minutes and strain through a fine sieve to remove the seeds. Pour
the hot tomato juice over the gelatin and stir until it is dissolved.
Add the salt, onion juice, and the sugar and chill. When the gelatin
mixture is partly set, add the finely shredded vegetables and mix well.
Add more salt if needed. Pour into wet custard cups and place in the
cold until set. Turn these molds out on crisp lettuce leaves and
serve with mayonnaise.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">Breads</span></h2>
<h3 id="c27">Boston Brown Bread</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 cup corn meal.</dt>
<dt>1 cup rye meal.</dt>
<dt>1 cup whole wheat flour.</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; cup molasses.</dt>
<dt>2 cups sour milk and 1&frac12; teaspoons soda, or 1&frac34; cups sweet milk and 4 teaspoons baking powder.</dt></dl>
<p>Mix and sift the dry ingredients; add the molasses and the milk.
Beat the mixture thoroughly. Pour the batter into a greased tin can
or mold until it is about three-fourths full. Cover, and steam for
3&frac12; hours. Remove the cover, and bake the bread in a moderate
oven for &frac12; hour to dry it off. If the bread seems likely to crumble,
loop a clean string around the loaf and cut slices by pulling the ends
of the string.</p>
<h3 id="c28">Cheese Straws</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 cup flour.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>&frac14; cup fat.</dt>
<dt>1 cup grated cheese.</dt>
<dt>&sup1;/&#8321;&#8326; teaspoon cayenne.</dt>
<dt>3 tablespoons water.</dt></dl>
<p>Cut the flour, salt, cayenne, fat, and one-half of the cheese together
with a biscuit cutter until the mass is well blended. Add the water
and mix well. Toss on a slightly floured board and roll 2 or 3 times
until the dough is smooth. Sprinkle on one half of the remainder of
the cheese and roll again. Repeat this until all the cheese is used.
Roll the mass out until about &frac14; inch thick. Cut in strips &frac12; inch
wide and 6 inches long. Place the strips on a baking sheet and bake
until a delicate brown, in a hot oven, about 400&deg;F.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c29">Waffles</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1&frac12; cups milk.</dt>
<dt>2 cups sifted cake flour.</dt>
<dt>3 tablespoons fat.</dt>
<dt>2 eggs.</dt>
<dt>3 teaspoons baking powder.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; tablespoons sugar.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; teaspoon salt.</dt></dl>
<p>Mix the dry ingredients, add the milk and egg yolks, then the
melted fat, and lastly fold in the beaten whites of eggs. Have the
waffle iron hot enough to brown the waffle quickly and well greased
unless it is the electrically heated aluminum kind. In that case, add
an extra tablespoon of melted shortening to the batter.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">Desserts</span></h2>
<h3 id="c31">Chocolate Souffle</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>&frac12; cup sugar.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; cup fine dry bread crumbs.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon flour.</dt>
<dt>1 tablespoon butter.</dt>
<dt>1&frac12; squares unsweetened chocolate.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; cup milk.</dt>
<dt>4 eggs.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla.</dt></dl>
<p>Mix the flour and butter, add the milk, and stir over heat until
thickened. Melt the chocolate over steam, and add to the cream sauce,
with the salt, bread crumbs, sugar, vanilla, and well beaten egg yolks.
Beat well. Fold in the well beaten whites of the eggs. Pour into a
greased 1&frac12; quart pudding dish and bake in a slow oven (325&deg;F.) for
1 hour, or until well set in the middle. Serve hot with the hard sauce
(<a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c32">Hard Sauce</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>&frac14; cup butter.</dt>
<dt>&frac34; cup powdered sugar.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla.</dt>
<dt>&#8539; teaspoon grated nutmeg.</dt></dl>
<p>Cream together the butter and sugar, add the vanilla and nutmeg.
The secret of creamy hard sauce lies in long beating. Chill before
serving.</p>
<h3 id="c33">Rocks</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1&frac12; cups light brown sugar.</dt>
<dt>1 cup butter.</dt>
<dt>3 eggs, well beaten.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon soda in a little hot water.</dt>
<dt>1 teaspoon cinnamon.</dt>
<dt>3 cups raisins, chopped.</dt>
<dt>1 cup English walnut meats, chopped.</dt>
<dt>2&frac34; cups flour.</dt>
<dt>&frac12; teaspoon salt.</dt></dl>
<p>Cream the butter and sugar and add the eggs. Sift the dry ingredients,
reserving some flour to roll the raisins and nuts. Mix all
together. Place by teaspoonfuls on a greased pan and bake in a
hot oven (375&deg;F.).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c34">Baked Caramel Custard</h3>
<dl class="ss undent"><dt>1 quart milk.</dt>
<dt>5 eggs.</dt>

<dt>&frac12; teaspoon vanilla.</dt>
<dt>&frac14; cup caramel sirup.</dt>
<dt>&frac14; teaspoon salt.</dt>
<dt>Butter.</dt></dl>
<p>Heat the milk slightly with the sugar, salt, and caramel sirup.
Be sure the caramel sirup is entirely dissolved before this mixture
is poured into the lightly beaten eggs. Add the vanilla. Pour the
mixture into custard cups, and add a small piece of butter to each.
Bake in a pan surrounded by water in a slow oven (325&deg;F.). Test
by placing the point of a knife in the center of the custard and if it
comes out clean remove the cups of custard at once from the hot
water. The custards may be served either hot or cold with caramel
sirup if more caramel flavor is desired.</p>
<p>Sugar can be caramelized easily by placing it in a heavy skillet over
slow even heat, and stirring it constantly until it melts and becomes
a heavy brown sirup. As soon as it reaches this stage take it from
the fire at once, and use it for flavoring and sweetening the custard.</p>
<h3 id="c35">Apple Dumplings</h3>
<p>Roll the pastry in a thin sheet and cut it in rounds. Place a whole,
cored apple in center of each round of pastry.</p>
<p>Sprinkle sugar over the apple, dot with butter, and bring the edges
of the pastry together over the apple. Bake in muffin pans, in a
moderate oven (350&deg;F.) until apple is tender, about 1 hour. Serve
hot with hard sauce (<a href="#Page_9">page 9</a>).</p>
<h3 id="c36">Sour Cream Pie</h3>

<p>Beat the eggs. Mix the spices with the sugar, and add to the eggs
with the raisins, cream, salt, and vinegar. Beat well. Pour the mixture
into a deep, pastry-lined pie pan. Moisten the outer rim of the
pastry, and press the top crust over the lower one to hold in the
custard. Bake in a moderate oven (350&deg;F.) until golden brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>

small amount of hot mixture into the eggs; stir egg mixture into
the remaining hot mixture. Stir until it starts to thicken. Add the
butter. Line a pie pan with pastry and bake until light brown. Pour
the hot filling into a baked crust. Bake the pie in a moderately hot
oven (400&deg;F.) until the filling sets.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
